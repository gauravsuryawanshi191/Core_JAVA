Day 1
1. Refer to "Installation Instructions" from day1-data\day1_help & complete the same.

2. MUST go through "sequence.txt"  from day1-data\day1_help\ & day1-data\day1_help\slides\PPTDay1.pdf

3. Go through  code samples from day1-data\code\src

4. Solve (Hands on)
4.1 Accept 2 double values from User (using Scanner). Check data type.
. If arguments are not doubles , supply suitable error message & terminate.
If numbers are double values , print its average.
Hint : Method of Scanner to use : hasNextDouble , nextDouble 

4.2 Display food menu to user. User will select items from menu along with the quantity. (eg 1. Dosa 2. Samosa 3. Idli ... 10 . Generate Bill ) Assign fixed prices to food items(hard code the prices)
When user enters 'Generate Bill' option(10) , display total bill & exit.


OR 
Create java application for the following
Accept 2 numbers from user & operation to perform
1. Add 2.Subtract 3. Multiply 4.Divide 5.Exit
Display the result of the operation. 
Java app must continue to run till user chooses exit option.

  Tank(int l)
   {
     level=l;
   }
  public void setLevel(int level1)
  {
    level=level1;

  {
    return level;
  }
}	

public class Assignment {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Tank t1 = new Tank(10);
    Tank t2 = new Tank(20);
     s.o.p("1: t1.level: " + t1.getLevel() +
          ", t2.level: " + t2.getLevel());
    t1 = t2;//1st tank obj is marked GC
    s.o.p("2: t1.level: " + t1.getLevel() +
          ", t2.level: " + t2.getLevel());
    t1.setLevel(27);
     s.o.p("3: t1.level: " + t1.getLevel() +
          ", t2.level: " + t2.getLevel());
    t2.setLevel(t1.getLevel()+10);
     s.o.p("4: t1.level: " + t1.getLevel() +
          ", t2.level: " + t2.getLevel());
  }
}

3. What will happen (solve ready code samples : along with mem pics )
day2-data\day2_help\params_passing
3.1 TestParamPassing1.java
3.2 TestParamPassing1.java

4. Hands on

Create a  class Point2D   for representing a point in x-y co-ordinate system.

4.1 Create a parameterized constructor to accept x & y co-ords.

4.2 Add  show() method  --to return point's x & y co-ords
eg : public String show() {.....}

4.3 (Optional work)
Add a non static  , isEqual method to Point2D class : boolean returning method : must return true if both points are having same x,y co-ords or false otherwise.

How will you invoke it from the tester 
A Hint : 

eg : p1.isEqual(p2); 
OR
p2.isEqual(p1)

4.4 (Optional work)
Add a non static method , calculateDistance , to calc distance between 2 points
Hint : use distance formula.

eg : In Tester :
double distance=p1.calculateDistance(p2);

4.5  Create a driver  class(for UI )  , "TestPoint" , with main(..)

4.6  Accept x,y co-ordinates for 2 points n store the co-ordinates
4.7  Display x,y co-ordinates of both of the points plotted  (using show() method)
4.8  (Optional work)
Find out if the points  are same or different (Hint : isEqual)
Print the message accordingly. (print SAME or DIFFERENT)
If points are not same , display distance between these 2 points.


5. Answer this : 

1. Conside below class.
class Emp
{
  private int id;
  private String name;
  private static int noOfEmps;
}
Suppose you create , 10 emps objects, 

How many copies of
id : 
name : 
noOfEmps : 

6. In  code(line no 1--6) , how many classes are loaded ?
how many objs ? 

psvm(....) { 
1. Scanner sc;
2. Emp e;
3. Box b;
4. Date d;
5. String s;
6. int[] data;
}


Day 4.
Refer to today's sequence : 
1. import day4.1 , in your IDE's workspace , to revise
1.1 for-each loop with primitive arrays
1.2 Array of references
1.3 static data members , methods , init blocks , import static
(refer to a readme)
1.4 Constructor invocation , in the inheritance hierarchy
(super(...)
1.5 Method overriding basic example , to see run time polymorphism.

Solve : 
1.6 Continue with Box class n TestBox , from today's code.
Solve :  
 Double box width for all boxes having volume > 100.(Can you use for-each & solve this) 


2. Solve (can be solved in IDE)
Continue with Day 2' Point2D class.

2.1   Create a driver  class(for UI)  , in the "tester" package "TestPoints" , with main(..)

1. Prompt user , how many points to plot? 
Create suitable array. (Hint : array of references)



2. Show following options

Options
1. Plot a point
Inputs : array index , x  ,y
Check boundary conditions  , check if some point is already plotted at the same index , if not then store the point details.
In case of any errors , display suitable error message.

2.   Display x,y co-ordinates of all the points plotted so far ,using for-each loop.

3.   Accept 2 indices from user .
Find out if the points at these indices are same or different (Hint : isEqual)
Print the message accordingly. 
If points are not same , display distance between these 2 points.
(Draw mem diagram for your clarity, if needed/)

0. Exit 



Day 5
1. import day5.1 in your workspace , refer to today's sequence
Revise
types of polymorphism
upcasting , downcasting n instanceof keyword
Object class Methods : toString n equals

2. Solve readymade code from 
"day5-data\day5_help\ready code"

Open these java src files n guess what will happen ?
Compile time error
Run time error
If no errs , what will be o/p ?


3. Answer this
When you invoke System.out.println(Object ref) , how it auto calls ref.toString ?
Hint : refer Java docs

4. Try to complete , Day 4 point array assignment
OPTIONAL WORK (after completing all of above, if time permits)


Hands on 
Read complete assignment n then only solve.

4.1 Can you arrange Fruit,Apple,Orange,Mango in inheritance hierarchy ?
Use tight encapsulation.

4.2 Properties (instance variables)  : color : String , weight : double , name:String, fresh : boolean

4.3 Add suitable constructor

4.4 Override  toString correctly to return state of all fruits (return only  : name ,color , weight )

4.5 Add a taste() method : public String taste()

For Fruit : Can you identify taste of any general fruit ? NO
So add a taste() with this definition : returns "no specific taste" 

Apple : should return  "sweet n sour"
Mango : should return  "sweet"
Orange : should return  "sour"

4.6 Add specific functionality , in the sub classes
In Mango : public void pulp() {Display name n color of the fruit + a mesg  creating  pulp!}
In Orange : public void juice() {Display name n weight of the fruit + a mesg extracting juice!}
In Apple : public void jam() {Display name of the fruit + a mesg  making jam!}

4.7 Add all of above classes under the package "com.app.fruits"
4.8 Create java application FruitBasket , with main method , as a tester
4.9 Prompt user for the basket size n create suitable data structure

4.10 Supply options
1. Add Mango
2. Add Orange
3. Add Apple
NOTE : You will be ALWAYS adding a fresh fruit in the basket , in all of above options.

4. Display names of all fruits in the basket.

5. Display name,color,weight , taste of all fresh fruits , in the basket.


6. Mark a fruit in a basket , as stale(=not fresh)
i/p : index 
o/p : error message (in case of invalid index) or mark it stale

7. Mark all sour fruits stale 
Hint : Use equals() method of the String class.

8. Invoke fruit specific functionality (pulp / juice / jam)
i/p : index
Invoke correct functionality (pulp / juice / jam)

9. Exit 



Day 6
No NEW coding assignments !!!!!
Please complete pending work , with the help of lab faculty.

1. Answer this : 
Can a sub class reference DIRECTLY refer to super class instance ?????

What will happpen if you apply downcasting ???? : 

What will happen ?
Person p=new Person("a1","b1");
Student s=p;

Student s=(Student) p;
s.study();

2. import day6.1 to revise
overriding of equals method

3. import day6.2 to revise

4. import day6.2 to revise , introduction to Java interfaces.
